# 4D_camera
Render a 4D object to 3D just like using a 4D camera

This project is inspired by: [yugu233](yugu233.com) and his project [4D](https://github.com/Crispher/4D). I think it's interesting and want to build a cpp/openGL version of it instead of typejs/three.js.

Some of the codes taken from [tendo518](https://github.com/tendo518)

Still have some problems. 3D Cube not rendering, 4D rotate not right, some camera issue
