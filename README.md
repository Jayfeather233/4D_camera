# 4D_camera
Render a 4D object to 3D just like using a 4D camera

This project is inspired by: [yugu233](yugu233.com) and his project [4D](https://github.com/Crispher/4D). I think it's interesting and want to build a cpp/openGL version of it instead of typejs/three.js.

Some of the codes taken from [tendo518](https://github.com/tendo518) and [learnopengl](https://learnopengl.com/)

### Movement:

For moving 4D Cam: `qweasd` for rotation, `zx` for zoom in/out;

For moving 3D Cam: `ijkl` for rotation, `nm` for zoom in/out
